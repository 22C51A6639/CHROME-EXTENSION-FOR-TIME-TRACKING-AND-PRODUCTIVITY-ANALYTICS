As part of my CodTech internship, I developed a Chrome Extension that tracks how much time a user spends on different websites and classifies them as productive (like coding platforms) or unproductive (like social media). The extension runs in the background, records time spent on each site, and sends that data to a Node.js backend. This backend stores the data and provides a summary through a separate dashboard page. The dashboard shows a clean weekly report displaying how many minutes were spent productively and unproductively, helping users understand and improve their online habits
